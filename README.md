# Chai ERC20 Tokens

This project can be used to create our own ERC20 tokens. In this project i have created ERC20 tokens which name is "Chai" 
and it can be used to buy chai from the https://kadakchai.netlify.app/ (one of my project which name is "But First Chai" https://github.com/ajeetram/But--first-Chai) and also we can send some chai tokens to any other addresses.It also take care that how much tokens we have left and how many users we have transfered the tokens.
